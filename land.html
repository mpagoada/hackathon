          <h1> Land and Forest</h1>
          <p id="quirky">What happened to the forest in your neighbourhood where there's construction going on?</p>
          <h1> Information </h1>
          <p> Deforestation affects the people and animals where trees are cut, as well as the wider world. Removing trees deprives the forest of portions of its canopy, which blocks the sun's rays during the day and retains heat at night. That disruption leads to more extreme temperature swings that can be harmful to plants and animals. Farming, grazing of livestock, mining, and drilling combined account for more than half of all deforestation. Forestry practices, wildfires and, in small part, urbanization account for the rest. 
Deforestation also contributes to global warming, since when they are cut down, their stored carbon is released into the air as carbon dioxide (greenhouse effect)</p>
          <h1> Help </h1>
          <li>Plant more trees and plants! Also avoid or boycott wooden products as they contribute to deforestation.</li>
          <li>Go paperless! Try to use paper as least as possible, and do not waste any existent sheets.</li>
          <li>Recycle any paper and cardboard you own, in order to avoid using new ones.</li>
          <li>Avoid buying products with palm oil! It mostly comes from cleared land, contributing to deforestation.</li>
