  <h1> Air Pollution </h1>
  <p id="quest"> The sky looks darker and foggier than normal today and it is not supposed to rain today? </p>
  
  <p> Air pollution is a mix of particles and gases that can reach harmful concentrations both outside and indoors. Its effects can range from higher disease risks to rising temperatures. Air pollutants cause less-direct health effects when they contribute to climate change. Heat waves, extreme weather, food supply disruptions, and other effects related to increased greenhouse gases can have negative impacts on human health.
     Most air pollution comes from very populated cities, such as New York City. The dependency of public transportation and cars affects the air, impacting the health of not only people but animals as well.
